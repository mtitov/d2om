D2OM ORM (Data to Object Mapper) is an object-relational mapping library
for the Python language, providing a framework for mapping an object-oriented
domain model to a traditional relational databases.

It's a lightweight implementation with an absence of ability to create/manage
a database structure. It gives possibility to manage objects based on data
from database (MySQL, Oracle), AKA data management interface.

This project was encouraged by other ORMs such as autumn and mostly by peewee.
